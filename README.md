# umn-edx-module-1-challenge-code-refactor

## Summary
This is my code for the first homework/challenge from the Minnesota Coding Bootcamp.  The general idea was refactor the HTML page to use semantic tags, but I also took the opportunity to slim down the CSS a bit since there were classes with the same styling that were used once.

## Notes
Since the affected classes no longer have any specific styling, I debated removing them from the HTML entirely as they no longer seemed to serve any purpose, but ultimately decided to leave them there in case there are changes down the line that might use them.

I also wanted to condense all the definitions of text color to white as the default and have black for the footer, but left it as is since two separate elements with text in the footer meant minimal reduction in the CSS length.
